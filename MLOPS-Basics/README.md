## Introduction to MLOPS

- **What is MLOPS?**
  - MLOps, short for Machine Learning Operations, is a set of practices that **combines Machine Learning (ML) with DevOps principles to streamline and automate the end-to-end lifecycle of machine learning models**.
    
  - It aims to **bridge the gap between data science and IT operations**, ensuring that ML models are efficiently developed, deployed, monitored, and maintained in production environments.

### Why do we need MLOPS ?
- For that first we will understand the Old ML workflow below:

#### Breakdown

**1. Understanding Problem/Use Case**
- Objective: Clearly define the problem you are trying to solve and understand the use case.
  - Steps:
    - Identify the business or technical problem.
    - Gather domain knowledge and establish success criteria.
    - Understand the type of data required (structured, unstructured, etc.).
    - Define measurable goals (e.g., accuracy, response time).

**2. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**
- Objective: Explore the dataset to understand its structure, patterns, and potential anomalies.
  - Steps:
    - Visualize the data using graphs, charts, and distributions.
    - Summarize statistics (mean, median, variance, etc.).
    - Detect missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
    - Identify correlations and relationships between features.

**3. Pre-Processing**
- Objective: Clean and transform the raw data into a suitable format for analysis.
  - Steps:
    - Handle missing values (e.g., imputation, removal).
    - Normalize or standardize data to bring it to a common scale.
    - Convert categorical data into numerical form (e.g., one-hot encoding).
    - Remove duplicates and irrelevant data.

**4. Feature Engineering**
- Objective: Create new features or modify existing ones to improve model performance.
  - Steps:
    - Generate new variables (e.g., aggregating data over time).
    - Apply domain knowledge to create meaningful features.
    - Combine or split features (e.g., extracting "month" from a date).

**5. Feature Selection**
- Objective: Choose the most relevant features for the model to improve performance and reduce complexity.
  - Steps:
    - Use techniques like correlation analysis, mutual information, or feature importance.
    - Remove redundant or less relevant features.
    - Apply dimensionality reduction methods (e.g., PCA).

**6. Model Training & Hyperparameter Tuning**
- Objective: Train machine learning models and optimize their performance by fine-tuning parameters.
  - Steps:
    - Select appropriate algorithms (e.g., regression, decision trees, neural networks).
    - Split data into training, validation, and test sets.
    - Train the model using the training dataset.
    - Perform hyperparameter tuning using techniques like grid search or random search.

**7. Model Evaluation**
- Objective: Assess the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics.
  - Steps:
    - Evaluate the model on the test set.
    - Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or AUC-ROC.
    - Validate robustness by cross-validation or testing on unseen datasets.

**8. App Building/UI**
- Objective: Integrate the model into a user-friendly application or interface.
  - Steps:
    - Build APIs or web/mobile interfaces for model interaction.
    - Allow users to input data and visualize outputs.
    - Design clear and intuitive workflows for users.

**9. Deploy**
- Objective: Deploy the trained model to production for real-world usage.
  - Steps:
    - Use deployment platforms (e.g., AWS, GCP, Docker).
    - Monitor the modelâ€™s performance and ensure scalability.
    - Implement CI/CD pipelines for continuous updates.
